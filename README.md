# Tic Tac Toe
## Overview:
This Tic-Tac-Toe program implements a console based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game allows players to place their mark (‘X’ or ‘O’) on a 3x3 grid. In this game, the board and moves are managed by a singly linked list. A singly linked list is a dynamic data structure where each element (Node) contains data and a reference to the next node. The last node points to null, which indicates the end of the list. In this program, the linked list consists of 9 nodes, which represent the 9 cells of the tic-tac-toe board.
